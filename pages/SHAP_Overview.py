st.markdown("""
**SHAP** (**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations) is a powerful method for interpreting machine learning models.  
It assigns each feature a contribution value showing how much that feature pushed the prediction up or down.

üîç **Why use SHAP?**
- Understand *why* a model made a specific prediction.
- Reveal which features are most influential for each individual prediction.
- Support trust, transparency, and auditability in ML systems ‚Äî especially important for clinicians and decision-makers.

**How does it work?**
SHAP is based on cooperative game theory. Imagine each feature as a player in a game, and the prediction as the payout.  
SHAP calculates how much each feature contributes to the final prediction by comparing all possible combinations of features.

**In this dashboard**, SHAP values show how your input features (like `BMI`, `Income`, `Age`, etc.) influence the predicted **risk of prediabetes**.
