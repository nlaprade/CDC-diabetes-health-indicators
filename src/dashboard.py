    - The **Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset** is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/891/cdc+diabetes+health+indicators), originally compiled by the CDC through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

    - It contains survey-based health statistics and lifestyle factors from over 250,000 U.S. adults, including metrics like BMI, physical activity, mental health, and socioeconomic indicators.  
    
    - This dashboard focuses on binary classification between **healthy individuals (class 0)** and those with **prediabetes (class 1)**, using engineered features to explore risk stratification and model interpretability.

        - **Income_Age**: Ratio of income to age, capturing economic maturity.
