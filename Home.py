These models were chosen for their strong performance on structured health data and compatibility with SHAP for interpretability:

- **`XGBoost`**  
  A high-performance gradient boosting model known for its accuracy and speed. Widely used in clinical machine learning tasks due to its robustness and SHAP support.

- **`Random Forest`**  
  An ensemble of decision trees that reduces overfitting and handles feature interactions well. Offers reliable performance and intuitive feature importance.

- **`Extra Trees`**  
  Similar to Random Forest but uses more randomness during tree construction. Often faster and can improve generalization.

- **`HistGradientBoosting`**  
  A fast, scalable boosting model optimized for large datasets. Supports missing values natively and integrates well with SHAP.

- **`Gradient Boosting`**  
  A classic boosting method that builds trees sequentially to correct errors. Included for comparison with more modern variants.

---

### Why These Models?
These models balance `predictive power`, `clinical transparency`, and `interpretability`, making them ideal for risk prediction in prediabetes.  
Each was tuned for depth, learning rate, and ensemble size using cross-validation.

- Thresholds were selected using precision-recall curves and F1 maximization  
- SHAP values were used to audit decision boundaries and promote borderline cases  
- Models were saved with calibrated thresholds for deployment stability

---

### Deployment Strategy
- All models were wrapped in a modular pipeline for reproducibility  
- SHAP explanations are rendered live for both global and local interpretability  
- Risk tiers (`Low`, `Moderate`, `High`, `Very High`) are assigned based on predicted probabilities and SHAP impact

---

### Model Evaluation Highlights
- **`Accuracy`** Consistently high across folds, with XGBoost and HistGradientBoosting leading  
- **`F1 Score`** Optimized for borderline cases to reduce false negatives in high-risk groups  
- **`Calibration`** Probability outputs checked for clinical reliability and interpretability  
- **`SHAP Insights`** Top predictors include BMI, Age, and Blood Pressure, which aligns with clinical evidence

This approach ensures that predictions are not only accurate, but also explainable and clinically meaningful.
